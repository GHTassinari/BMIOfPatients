# BMIOfPatients
This is a simple project that uses the height and weight, of some patients defined in an object, and show their BMI.

It uses functions, objects and a repeat loop (for), to show the BMI of some patients.
The calculations are done at the function, and they will return at the for, being shown as an alert.
